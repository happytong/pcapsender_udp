Python Program to Send Wireshark Data Frames
This python prgram will 
· Read .pcap files: Parse packet capture files generated by tools like Wireshark or tcpdump.
· Filter specified packets: Selectively transmit packets based on destination port.
· Respect timestamps: Ensure packet transmission adheres to original timing, with a maximum interval (5 seconds between packets).
· Customize source/destination IPs: Modify IP headers to reroute packets as needed.
· Log activity: Save transmitted packets and basic statistics (e.g., packet count, errors) to a text file.
· Extract packets: Convert .pcap data into a readable text format for analysis.
